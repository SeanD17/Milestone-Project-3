## Structure:


I also provided my profile links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

## Surface:
I used orange text color to make it stand out against the background.

The orange background footer and red background header was chosen to stand out on the site.

## Icons:
I used Font Awesome for the social media icons of GitHub and LinkedIn,as well as for various icons seen throughout the site.

## Wireframes:
I have included wireframes for each page on this website,these can be found on the wireframes folder:
