## UX:

## User Stories:
As a User:

"I want to see all the books on this site that users have rated and commented on"

![Book List](static/images/show_books.png)

"If there is a book im interested in, i want to learn more about this book and where to go to buy it"

![Book Details](static/images/show_books.png)

"I want to either create an account or login to the site so that i can add my own book details"

![Register](static/images/register.png)

![Add Category](static/images/add_category.png)

"I want to edit a book category on the site"

![Edit Category Link](static/images/edit_category_link.png)

![Edit Category](static/images/edit_category.png)

"I want to delete a category from the site"

![Delete Category Link](static/images/delete_category_link.png)

## Strategy:
I wanted to create a user friendly website that would have Create,Update,Read and Delete (CRUD) functionality.

## Scope:
I created a database for the website on MongoDB,see below schema

![Database Schema](static/images/database_schema.png)

## Structure:
I wanted users to see all the books on the site that have been rated and commented on.

I would then direct them to the Login/Register pages.

After the user has logged in they would now have the option of adding a book to the site.

If the admin has logged in they would now have the option of deleting/editing books,and adding/editing categories.

I also provided my profile links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

## Surface:
I used various text colors to make it stand out against the background.

The orange background footer and red background header was chosen to stand out on the site.

## Icons:
I used Font Awesome for the social media icons of GitHub and LinkedIn,as well as for various icons seen throughout the site.

## Wireframes:
I have included wireframes for each page on this website, click on the below page names to see these wireframes:
